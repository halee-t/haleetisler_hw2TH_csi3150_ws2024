      Hello! My name is Halee and I am a 20 year-old Software Developer. I am
      currently pursuing my students in Computer Science at Oakland University
      where I plan to graduate in the spring of 2025. I graduated from Clarkston
      High School where I was heavily involved in Drama Club and Acappella. In
      College, I became the Treasurer for Girl Gains OU and a coordinator for
      GrizzHacks OU.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 2023 I completed a 12-week long Software Development
      internship at 365 Retail Markets in Troy, MI. While there, I gained
      countless technical skills along with learning how to become a better
      developer. I even went on to compete in and win my first hackathon with my
      team. I am grateful for the time spent at my previous internship and am
      excited to see where I will go and what I will learn next. If you would
      like to know more about me and my journey, check out my
